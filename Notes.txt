GAMELOOP
Important aspect for any game is GameLoop
It controls how the game runs actually like going left or right
It consists of three parts:
1. Init- whatever data/assets the game needs it loads (Happens for only once)
    a. Preloading the assets
    b. Initializing game object
    c. initial rendering of the game
2. Update- all the changes/occassions throughout the running of game. 
It is sort of an infinite loop, which is synced with the screen frame
    a. Input Update
    b. animation update
    c. Physics update
    d. Render update
3. Reset- when player either loses or quits the game (Game over Logic- Happens for only once)

ANIMATION
Persistence of Vision- if any image is replaced within 1/16 seconds then it looks like animation
Animations in our game:
Right/Left-> Either walk, Jump or stand looking at right/left

BACKGROUND
consists of : Clouds, Shrubs, Bricks, Pipes, Mountains, Stair, Flag,Castle 
We need the image and coordinates of these entities
After getting them, we need to build them with Sprite and Entity classes
